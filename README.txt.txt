--WARNING--

Before using the website, it is important to mention that this is not a standalone site and by that it needs some form of php server (XAMPP used to develop the project).

It was developed using the technologies of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL and the beginning point of the site is: "index.php". 

It is also important to mention that a database needs to be created for the sake of running the actual website, please refer to importing the "bbc.sql" file into your database platform and naming the database itself "bbc". 

Thank you for your understanding. Cheers.
